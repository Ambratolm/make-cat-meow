## üìù Note
I made this while playing around with .NET drawing and media APIs. I was inspecting .NET capabilities for making a simple 2D game without using a dedicated C# game engine or framework.

## ‚ú® Features
The game itself has no real deal but the code may be useful as a basic example for drawing an image, moving it on user input, playing sounds. As for what you can do:

- You can move the cat in four direction.
- You can make random holes in the ground on click.
- There is sound effects.

For the gameplay, as the name says, you must **find a way to make the cat meow**. There's a secret spot that plays a cat meowing sound on click, you just have to find it. The **four direction movement** and **random holes making** abilites has no gameplay meaning for the moment.
